I saw this and wanted to try it out. It's supposed to be more featureful than nano but less intimidating than
Vim. It's pretty neat, with mouse support out of the box, but I found myself continuing to use Vim so I do not
use this anymore. I keep its configuration file here in case I ever wanted to use it again, or for someone else.
