I saw this and wanted to try it out. It's supposed to be more featureful than `nano` but less intimidating than
`vim`. It's pretty neat, with mouse support out of the box, but I found myself continuing to use `vim` so I do not
use this anymore. I keep its configuration file here in case I ever want to use it again, or for someone else.
