# virtualenv

As mentioned in the [top-level README](../README.md), [virtualenv] is my tool of choice for creating Python virtual environments.
By default, when creating virtual environments, it will create activation scripts for a varierty of shells: Bash, Fish, PowerShell, etc.,
but I only need Bash, whose activation script is compatible with Zsh. That's what the configuration file in this directory specifies.
