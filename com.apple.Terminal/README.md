# Apple Terminal

So most Mac users use [iTerm 2][iterm2] but I've stuck with the built-in Terminal.app since it gets the job done
and I've never been compelled to switch. I would consider [Kitty][kitty] before switching to iTerm 2. Either way,
this directory contains some custom themes I like. They're just slight modifications of some of the built-in themes,
namely the built-in theme with a different font. You can tell which built-in theme and which font each of my custom
themes uses based on the name of the custom theme :wink:. They use specific fonts that will have to be installed
with Homebrew: `brew install --cask font-droidsansmono-nerd-font font-iosevka-nerd-font font-meslolg-nerd-font font-sf-mono-nerd-font`.
